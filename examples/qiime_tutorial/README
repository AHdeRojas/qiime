The QIIME tutorial contains two shell scripts that a user can run. You will need an appropriate template alignment. Run "print_qiime_config.py", and view:

pynast_template_alignment_fp

The paths should be changed to point to the greengenes core set alignment on your system. As of April 2010, you can grab this file from:

http://greengenes.lbl.gov/Download/Sequence_Data/Fasta_data_files/core_set_aligned.fasta.imputed

To use the shell scripts the user may need to make them executable by running one of the following commands:

chmod g+x ./qiime_tutorial_commands_serial.sh

or

chmod g+x ./qiime_tutorial_commands_parallel.sh


To run the shell scripts the user can use the following commands:

./qiime_tutorial_commands_serial.sh

or

./qiime_tutorial_commands_parallel.sh
