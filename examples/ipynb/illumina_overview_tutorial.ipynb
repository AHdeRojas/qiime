      "This tutorial covers a full QIIME workflow using Illumina sequencing data. This tutorial is intended to be quick to run, and as such, uses only a subset of a full Illumina Genome Analyzer II (GAIIx) run. We'll make use of the ``13_8`` release of the [Greengenes](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22134646) reference OTUs. You can always find a link to the latest version of the reference OTUs on the [QIIME resources page](http://qiime.org/home_static/dataFiles.html).\n",

      "The data used in this tutorial is derived from the [Moving Pictures of the Human Microbiome](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21624126) study, where two human subjects collected daily samples from four body sites: the tongue, the palm of the left hand, the palm of the right hand, and the gut (via fecal samples obtained by swapping used toilet paper). This data was sequenced using the barcoded amplicon sequencing protocol described in [Global patterns of 16S rRNA diversity at a depth of millions of sequences per sample](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20534432). A more recent version of this protocol that can be used with the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22402401). \n",

      " **IMPORTANT**: Removing points from a PCoA plot, as is suggested above for data exploration purposes, is not the same as computing PCoA without those points. If after running this, you'd like to remove the samples taken during ``AntibioticUsage`` from the analysis, you can do this with the ``filter_samples_from_otus_table.py``, which is discussed [here](http://qiime.org/tutorials/metadata_description.html). As a next exercise, try removing the samples taken during ``AntibioticUsage`` from the OTU table and re-running ``core_diversity_analyses.py``. You should output the results to a different directory than you created above (e.g., ``cd4370_no_abx``). "

If you're interested in seeing additional visualizations, you should check out the [QIIME overview tutorial](http://www.qiime.org/tutorials/tutorial.html). The [Procrustes analysis tutorial](http://www.qiime.org/tutorials/procrustes_analysis.html) illustrates a really cool analysis, allowing you to continue with the same data used here, comparing against the samples sequenced on 454 (rather than Illumina, as in this analysis). If you're interested in some possibilities for statistical analyses you can try the [supervised learning](http://www.qiime.org/tutorials/running_supervised_learning.html) or [distance matrix comparison](http://www.qiime.org/tutorials/distance_matrix_comparison.html) tutorials, both of which can be adapted to use data generated in this tutorial."
