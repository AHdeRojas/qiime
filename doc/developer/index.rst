QIIME Developer Notes
=====================

QIIME is an open-source project, and we are interested in recruiting new developers. If you are interested in getting involved, you should have some experience programming in Python. Please get in touch using via qiime.help@colorado.edu. Please provide details on your background, and attach some python code that you're proud of as a code sample. New developer's code goes through a peer-review process before being committed to QIIME.
