If your virtual machine does not have Internet access, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and run the following command:

  sudo lshw -c network

This should show you the network card(s) available to your virtual machine. Look for their "logical name" and write them down.

2. Run the following command to open a file for editing:

  sudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces

3. For each network card available, add entries to this file that look like:

  auto <logical_name>
  iface <logical_name> inet dhcp

For each entry, be sure to replace <logical_name> with the logical name of the network card from step 1.

4. Run the following command:

  sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart

You may need to restart the virtual machine again. You will only need to do this once.
