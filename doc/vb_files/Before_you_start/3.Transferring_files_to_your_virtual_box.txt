To analyze your data with the QIIME Virtual Box you will need to have access to your files inside of this virtual machine. There are several ways to accomplish this, including:

1. E-mail the data to yourself, if size permits, and check your email using a web browser (e.g., Firefox or Google Chrome) within the virtual box.

2. Create a shared folder between your real machine (the host) and the virtual machine (the guest):

  - At the bottom of the virtual machine screen there are some icons.
    On Mac OS X: Click once on the blue/grey folder.
    On Windows: Right-click on the blue/grey folder.
  - Select "Shared Folders Settings..."
  - A new window will open. Select the blue/grey folder icon with a green plus sign on the right of the new screen.
  - A new window will open. On the "Folder Path" option select the down arrow and click on the "Other..." option.
  - A new window will open. Select the folder that you want to share with your virtual machine. Click OK.
  - Change the "Folder Name" option to Shared_Folder, select the "Make Permanent" option and make sure that the "Read-only" option is not selected. Click OK.
  - Click OK.
  - Open a terminal on your virtual machine and run the following command:

    sudo mount -a

If you do this every time you restart your machine you will have the connection to your real machine through the Shared_Folder on your virtual machine desktop.

3. Post the data on an external server and retrieve it using wget, scp, sftp, etc.
