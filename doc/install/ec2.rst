QIIME EC2 Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is the QIIME EC2 image?
==============================
The QIIME EC2 image is a pre-built image containing QIIME and its dependencies developed for the Amazon Cloud. As of QIIME 1.2.0, the QIIME EC2 image is in public beta. We have done quite a bit of testing, but issues are still likely to come up. Any problems should be brought up in the `QIIME Forum <http://groups.google.com/group/qiime-forum>`_.

The QIIME EC2 image will allow users to load a fully-functional QIIME environment in their own Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts to make use of the compute resources available in Amazon's cloud.

================
We'd like to acknowledge the support of AWS: the QIIME EC2 image was developed using an AWS in Education (for Researchers) grant of compute resource time. 

As of the QIIME 1.2.0 release, the QIIME VB and EC2 images are built using `CloVR`_.  CloVR provides a platform for building portable virtual machines. The platform automates builds in formats compatible with VirtualBox, VMware, and Clouds, including Amazon EC2.  The `CloVR developer <http://clovr.org/developers>`_ pages have more information on the platform and build process.
