QIIME EC2 Image
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What is the QIIME EC2 image?
==============================
The QIIME EC2 image is a pre-built image containing QIIME and its dependencies developed for the Amazon Cloud. As of QIIME 1.2.0, the QIIME EC2 image is in public beta. We have done quite a bit of testing, but issues are still likely to come up. Any problems should be brought up in the `QIIME Forum <http://groups.google.com/group/qiime-forum>`_.

The QIIME EC2 image will allow users to load a fully-functional QIIME environment in their own Amazon Web Services (AWS) accounts to make use of the compute resources available in Amazon's cloud.

We'd like to acknowledge the support of AWS: the QIIME EC2 image was developed using an AWS in Education (for Researchers) grant of compute resource time.
